We're operating highly secure, fast and stable validator nodes for many mainnet and testnet blockchains, which are managed by experienced professionals. We've been operating validator nodes since May 2019, and we've acquired valuable experience in these 3 years. Also, we contribute the following to the EcoSystem.

1. We post technical tutorials on our Youtube channel for the community.
2. We're operating a Cosmos blockchain explorer at cosmosrun.info for both mainnets and testnets. This is based on ping.pub. We must take ping.pub for this.
3. We provide Snapshots on regular basis for both Mainnets and Testnets.
4. We're in the process of starting IBC Relayers between many cosmos blockchains. We already are operating a IBC Relayer on testnets.
5. We will provide more valuable services for the community as we expand our operations.

## Security Measures

We have setup the following security measures for all our Validator Nodes.

1. Firewall - deny all incoming traffic except for few important ports, such as 26656.
2. Hardware tied SSH Key Authentication to login to server. Without these keys, no one can login.
3. Remove default SSH port 22 and we are using an other port for SSH.
4. Removed SSH login using root password.
5. IP Lock - SSH login only allowed from 1 main IP, and allow temporary access to an other IP during travel.
6. Dedicated powerful servers for all our nodes with NVMe SSD. Updated a few settings for best performance to the server. Regularly check for new updates for the OS and update them.
7. Fully synced Backup server (even for Kujira Testnet) and we can switch to backup server within 5 mins if main sever is down.
8. PagerDuty alerts using Tenderduy with phone calls and email alerts which we have setup in an other independent server. This will notify us through phone call and email anytime if we miss 3 pre-commits.
